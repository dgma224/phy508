Estimating Errors

Binning Data

Determine if a cluster spans the lattice
  For open boundary conditions
    Easier to check
    it spans if there is a member on each opposing edges
      there must be connecting nodes in between
  for periodic boundary conditions
    must be an entry in each row or each column
      row vs column depends on the direction
      shouldn't be too hard to check
