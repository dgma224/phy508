I used GNUPLOT for all of the plotting in this particular assignment. Two of the scripts I used are in the files plotscript and secondscript. These will absolutely not work in Python.

List of files and their functions below:
smpl_pndlm.cpp | C++ Code
build.sh | build script
param.dat | param file
plotscript | GNUPlot script for the first graph
secondscript | GNUPlot script for the second graph
plot.py | Python script for generating the resonance and exact solutions data
        | values were sent to files with python plot.py > testfile
